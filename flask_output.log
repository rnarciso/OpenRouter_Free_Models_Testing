I remember there are some algebraic identities related to squares. Oh right, the square of a sum. Like (x + y) squared equals x squared plus 2xy plus y squared. That might help here.\n\nSo if I take (x + y)\u00b2 and plug in the known values. The problem says x + y is 7, so (7) squared is 49. On the other hand, expanding (x + y)\u00b2 gives me x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2. And from the first equation, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is 25. So substituting that in, the equation becomes 25 + 2xy = 49.\n\nNow I can solve for xy. Subtract 25 from both sides: 2xy = 49 - 25, which is 24. Then divide both sides by 2, so xy = 12. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over: (x + y)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2. We know x + y = 7, so 7\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2xy. But x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is given as 25. Therefore, 49 = 25 + 2xy. Subtract 25: 24 = 2xy. Divide by 2: xy = 12. Yep, that seems right.

        "content": "We are asked: If x^2 + y^2 = 25 and x + y = 7, what is the value of xy? We consider the identity: (x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2, then given x+y=7 so square of sum equals 7^2 =49. Then, plug given x^2 + y^2 = 25 so we have 49 = 25 + 2xy. Solve for xy: 2xy = 49 - 25 = 24, so xy =24/2 = 12.\n\nTherefore answer: xy = 12.\n\nDouble-check: Correct. But we must check if any offers check x-y pair? Consider quadratically: roots of equation t^2 - 7t + 12 = 0, then its discriminant is 49 - 48 =1 => roots are (7 \u00b1 1)/2 = 4, 3 making works consistent with x+y = 7, xy=12. Then x^2+y^2 = (4^2+3^2=16+9=25) Okay.\n\nI must produce answer only if asked. But caution: I must produce answer in plain text with explanation. I'll produce answer: \"xy = 12\".\n\nI must produce explanation: \"Solving (x+y)^2= x^2 +2xy + y^2 with given then answer is 12.\" Alternatively to produce explanation in decomposition.\n\nI'll produce answer text: \"xy=12.\"\n\nBut I must recall that assistant style response: \"I am Phi, etc\", and next I produce answer:\n\nWait: I must produce explanation and final answer. I'll produce explanation: \"By squaring both sides of the equation x+y=7, we get (x+y)^2=49, and using identity (x+y)^2= x^2+2xy+y^2 and substituting x^2+y^2=25, then we get: 49=25+2xy, rearranging terms gives 2xy=24, so xy=12.\" I'll produce answer.\n\nI'll produce answer: \"xy=12.\" I must produce: \"The product xy is 12.\" Then I produce note.\n\nI'll produce answer explanation and final answer in a final answer message.\n\nI'll produce output in plain text answer.\n\nI'll produce content answer explanation: \"Given x^2 + y^2 =25 and x+y=7, using identity (x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 +2xy, then 7^2=25+2xy, that is 49=25+2xy, 2xy=24 so xy=12.\" I'll produce answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer message.We are given:\n\u2003x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25\n\u2003x + y = 7\n\nRecall the identity:\n\u2003(x + y)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2\n\nSubstitute the given values into the identity:\n\u20037\u00b2 = 25 + 2xy\n\u200349 = 25 + 2xy\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\u200349 \u2212 25 = 2xy\n\u200324 = 2xy\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\u2003xy = 12\n\nThus, the value of xy is 12.",
