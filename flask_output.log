        "reasoning": "I have this problem: If x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25 and x + y = 7, what is the value of xy? I need to reason step by step and box my final answer.\n\nFirst, I know that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is given as 25, and x + y is 7. I need to find xy. I recall that (x + y)\u00b2 equals x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2. That might be useful.\n\nSo, if I square x + y, I get (x + y)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2.\n\nBut I already know x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is 25, and x + y is 7, so (x + y)\u00b2 should be 7 squared, which is 49.\n\nSo, that means x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2 = 49.\n\nAnd since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is 25, I can substitute that in.\n\nSo, 25 + 2xy = 49.\n\nNow, I just need to solve for xy.\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides: 2xy = 49 - 25.\n\n49 minus 25 is 24, so 2xy = 24.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2: xy = 24 / 2 = 12.\n\nThat seems straightforward. Let me double-check if that makes sense.\n\nIf x + y = 7 and x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25, then xy should be 12.\n\nLet me see if there are values for x and y that satisfy this.\n\nSuppose x and y are roots of some quadratic equation.\n\nThe quadratic would be t\u00b2 - (x+y)t + xy = 0.\n\nSo, t\u00b2 - 7t + 12 = 0.\n\nSolving that: factors to (t - 3)(t - 4) = 0, so t=3 or t=4.\n\nIf x=3, y=4, then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 9 + 16 = 25, yes.\n\nx+y=3+4=7, yes.\n\nxy=3*4=12.\n\nPerfect.\n\nx=4, y=3, same thing.\n\nSo, it works.\n\nIs there any other possibility? Like, if x and y are equal, but 7/2 = 3.5, then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 2*(3.5)\u00b2 = 2*12.25 = 24.5, which is less than 25, but not equal, so not possible.\n\nOr if they are negative, but x + y =7, positive, so both positive or both negative, but if both negative, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 would still be positive, but let's say x=-3, y=-4, then x+y=-7, not 7, so not.\n\nOr mixed signs, but x+y=7 positive, so same sign, both positive.\n\nx=3,y=4 or x=4,y=3.\n\nOr other values, but no.\n\nSo, xy=12.\n\nThe problem is to find xy, and I got 12.\n\nBut let me see the initial approach.\n\nI used (x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2, set equal to 49, and since x^2 + y^2=25, so 25 + 2xy=49, 2xy=24, xy=12.\n\nAnother way: I know that (x^2 + y^2) = (x+y)^2 - 2xy.\n\nSo, 25 = (7)^2 - 2xy\n\n25 = 49 - 2xy\n\nThen, 2xy = 49 - 25 = 24, same as before.\n\nxy=12.\n\nOkay, so I think that's solid.\n\nTherefore, the value of xy is 12.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n"
